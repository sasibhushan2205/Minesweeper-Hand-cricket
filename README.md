# Minesweeper-Hand-Cricket
Welcome to Minesweeper-Hand-Cricket, my inaugural CS project inspired by the classic Minesweeper game, a desktop favorite of yesteryears. This rendition, developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Hand-Cricket is a very famous game in our Home Town during My Childhood, So I came up with an idea which combines cricket with hand cricket and minesweeper.
